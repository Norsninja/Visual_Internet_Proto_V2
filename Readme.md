## **About This Project**

**Visual Internet Prototype (VIP)** is an attempt to **visually map the internet** using common network tools and present it as a **3D world that can be explored**. 

This version is primarily developed using **Python** for the backend, **Neo4j** for data storage, and **Three.js** with **React** for the frontend visualization. While developed by a non-expert, this project demonstrates how a combination of **experimentation, determination, and AI assistance** can produce sophisticated technical solutions.

The ultimate goal is to create an **exploration program** that **procedurally builds the network**, incorporating **emergent elements** to simulate the feeling of exploring something entirely new. Initial tests have **proven viability**, reinforcing the belief that this tool can be used not only to explore the internet but also to **secure local networks** through practical **network security tools**.

## **Core Features**

### **üîç Dynamic & Persistent Network Mapping**
- The map **updates dynamically**‚Äîif something on the network changes, the map changes as well
- Nodes represent **devices**, and **moons** around them symbolize **open ports** that can be further explored
- **Full persistency** with Neo4j graph database storage for historical analysis

### **üåê Web Scanning & Hyperlink Discovery**
- If an **open web port** is found, it can be **scanned further** to extract **hyperlinks**
- If the link **targets a new IP**, it is **added dynamically** to the network for further exploration
- **DNS resolution** and content analysis provide deeper insights into web resources

### **üì° BGP Scanning & Large-Scale Internet Mapping**
- Run a **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol) scan** to reveal **Autonomous Systems (ASNs)**
- **ASNs appear as larger nodes**, providing a **macro view of the internet**
- **Relationship mapping** between ASNs shows major internet backbone connections

### **üß† Intelligent Node Management**
- **Efficient State Management**: New GraphState system for centralized node data handling
- **Optimized Physics Engine**: Improved node positioning and movement simulation
- **Smart Caching System**: RequestQueue implementation to prevent API request thundering herds

### **üîí Network Security Analysis**
- **Port scanning** reveals potential entry points to network devices
- **Service detection** identifies running applications and potential vulnerabilities
- **Banner grabbing** and **service fingerprinting** for deeper security analysis

## **Technical Improvements**

### **Architecture Enhancements**
- **Modular Component Design**: Better separation of concerns between system components
- **Three.js Integration**: Advanced rendering techniques for better visualization
- **Optimized Rendering**: Significant performance improvements for large networks

### **Code Quality and Organization**
- **Enhanced Error Handling**: More robust error recovery throughout the system
- **Improved Async Operations**: Better handling of concurrent operations and network requests
- **Consistent Coding Patterns**: Standardized approaches to common tasks

### **Performance Optimizations**
- **Frame-Skipping Logic**: Heavy operations are staggered across frames for smoother performance
- **Batch Processing**: Resource-intensive tasks are grouped and processed in manageable chunks
- **Throttled Updates**: Animations and state changes are paced to maintain responsive UI

## **Previous Updates**

### **Changes for 2/24/25:**
- Added a local network traffic meter showing traffic on the local network and rate of change over time
- Removed testing files for the traffic_meter
- Added a retrieve relationship endpoint to routes.py
- Modified the camera and ship for flight navigation
- Implemented procedural node generation using Cellular Automata
- Added visual transformation when all required scans for a node are completed

### **Changes 2/22/25:**
- **Decoupled Scanning & Persistence**: Separated scanning functions from database updates with an orchestrator module
- **Improved Concurrency Management**: Added global lock to prevent overlapping scans
- **Focused Local Scanning**: Scheduled full scans now exclusively handle local network data
- **Dynamic External Target Synchronization**: System retrieves external target configuration from Neo4j
- **Consistent Labeling & Relationship Management**: Centralized node labeling and relationship creation

## **Known Issues and Areas for Improvement**
- Web nodes and web edges still have connectivity issues after web scans
- External network nodes could benefit from better organizational structure
- Some performance issues may occur with very large networks
- Further refinement needed for the genetic algorithm parameters

## **Future Development Plans**
- Enhance the genetic algorithm to create more meaningful visual patterns
- Implement more sophisticated physics for node organization
- Expand scanning capabilities to support additional protocols
- Further improve the UI/UX for more intuitive navigation
- Develop more advanced security analysis features
